Éclat is a color theme designed for extended reading, providing a peaceful atmosphere for a smooth coding experience. It is specifically built for visual compatibility with eye-protection tools like macOS Night Shift, ensuring the theme remains clear even when filters are active.

Unlike other "eye-care" themes that rely on green-tinted backgrounds or low-contrast colors, Éclat maintains a deep, modern aesthetic. Its secret lies in two design principles: a precise balance between luminance and saturation, and the complete omission of cyan and blue tones from the color palette.

I hope you can relax here!
